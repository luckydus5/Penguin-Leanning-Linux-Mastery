## Foundation Concepts

### Filesystem Hierarchy

Linux follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):

```
/                    # Root directory
├── bin/            # Essential user binaries
├── boot/           # Boot loader files
├── dev/            # Device files
├── etc/            # System configuration
├── home/           # User home directories
├── lib/            # Shared libraries
├── media/          # Removable media mount points
├── mnt/            # Temporary mount points
├── opt/            # Optional software
├── proc/           # Process information
├── root/           # Root user home
├── sbin/           # System binaries
├── srv/            # Service data

## Essential Commands: The Core Toolkit

This section covers the foundational commands for navigating and interacting with the Linux operating system. Mastering these is the first step toward proficiency.

#### Navigation and Exploration

These commands allow you to move around the filesystem and understand your current location.

| Command | Description | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pwd` | **P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory | `pwd` | Shows your current absolute path. |
| `ls` | **L**i**s**t directory contents | `ls -la` | The cornerstone of file listing. See below for a deep dive. |
| `cd` | **C**hange **D**irectory | `cd /var/log` | Your primary tool for moving between directories. |
| `find` | Search for files/directories | `find /home -name "*.log"` | A powerful and versatile search utility. |
| `locate` | Find files by name (fast) | `locate myapp.conf` | Uses a pre-built database. Run `sudo updatedb` to refresh it. |
| `which` | Locate a command | `which python3` | Shows the full path of an executable. |
| `tree` | Display directory structure | `tree -L 2` | Provides a visual tree. May require installation (`sudo apt install tree`). |

**Deep Dive: `ls` Command Variants**

The `ls` command is simple but incredibly powerful with its options.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ls` | List files and directories in the current location. |
| `ls -l` | **L**ong format: shows permissions, owner, size, and modification date. |
| `ls -a` | **A**ll files: includes hidden files (those starting with `.`). |
| `ls -h` | **H**uman-readable: displays file sizes in KB, MB, GB. Use with `-l`. |
| `ls -t` | **T**ime sort: lists newest files first. |
| `ls -S` | **S**ize sort: lists largest files first. |
| `ls -r` | **R**everse order: reverses the sorting order (e.g., `ls -ltr` shows oldest last). |
| `ls -R` | **R**ecursive: lists the contents of all subdirectories. |
| `ls -d */` | **D**irectory: lists only the directories in the current path. |

**Exercises: Navigation**

1.  Navigate to your home directory.
2.  List all files, including hidden ones, in long format.
3.  Create a new directory called `test_lab`.
4.  Navigate into `test_lab`.
5.  Confirm your current working directory.
6.  Navigate back to your home directory using a relative path (`..`).
7.  Find all files on your system ending with the `.conf` extension.

#### File & Directory Operations

Creating, deleting, copying, and moving files are fundamental tasks.

| Command | Description | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mkdir` | **M**a**k**e **Dir**ectory | `mkdir -p project/src` | `-p` creates parent directories if they don't exist. |
| `rmdir` | **R**e**m**ove **Dir**ectory | `rmdir empty_dir` | Only works on empty directories. |
| `rm` | **R**e**m**ove files/directories | `rm -rf old_project/` | `-r` for recursive, `-f` for force (use with caution!). |
| `cp` | **C**o**p**y files/directories | `cp -r source/ dest/` | `-r` is required for directories. |
| `mv` | **M**o**v**e or rename files | `mv old.txt new.txt` | The same command is used for both moving and renaming. |
| `touch` | Create empty file/update timestamp | `touch new_file.log` | Creates a file if it doesn't exist or updates the modification time if it does. |
| `ln` | Create **l**i**n**ks | `ln -s /path/to/target link_name` | `-s` creates a symbolic (soft) link. Without it, you get a hard link. |

**Deep Dive: `cp` Command Variants**

The `cp` command is essential for copying files and directories.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `cp file1.txt file2.txt` | Copy `file1.txt` to `file2.txt`. |
| `cp -i file1.txt file2.txt` | Prompt before overwrite. |
| `cp -r dir1/ dir2/` | Copy directory `dir1` to `dir2` recursively. |
| `cp -u file1.txt dir/` | Copy only if `file1.txt` is newer than the existing file in `dir`. |
| `cp -v file1.txt dir/` | Verbose mode: show files being copied. |

**Exercises: File Operations**

1.  Create a directory structure `~/my_project/assets/images`.
2.  Create an empty file named `~/my_project/index.html`.
3.  Copy `index.html` to `~/my_project/assets/`.
4.  Rename `~/my_project/assets/index.html` to `info.html`.
5.  Create a symbolic link from `~/my_project/assets/images` to `~/images_shortcut`.
6.  Remove the `~/images_shortcut` link.
7.  Remove the entire `~/my_project` directory and all its contents with a single command.

---

#### Users & Permissions

Linux is a multi-user system, and managing permissions is critical for security.

| Command | Description | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chmod` | **Ch**ange **Mod**e (permissions) | `chmod 755 script.sh` | Sets read/write/execute for owner, read/execute for others. |
| `chown` | **Ch**ange **Own**er | `chown www-data:www-data file` | Changes the user and group that owns a file. |
| `sudo` | **S**uper**u**ser **Do** | `sudo apt update` | Executes a command with root privileges. |
| `su` | **S**witch **U**ser | `su - john` | Switches to another user's session (`-` provides a login shell). |

**Deep Dive: `chmod`**

Permissions can be set using numbers (octal) or letters (symbolic).

*   **Numeric:** `r=4`, `w=2`, `x=1`. Sum them up for each entity (User, Group, Other).
    *   `chmod 755`: `rwx` for User, `r-x` for Group, `r-x` for Other.
    *   `chmod 644`: `rw-` for User, `r--` for Group, `r--` for Other.
*   **Symbolic:** `u` (user), `g` (group), `o` (other), `a` (all). `+` (add), `-` (remove), `=` (set).
    *   `chmod u+x script.sh`: Adds execute permission for the user.
    *   `chmod g-w data.txt`: Removes write permission for the group.
    *   `chmod a=r config.yml`: Sets read-only permission for everyone.

**Exercises: Permissions**

1.  Create a file named `secret.txt`.
2.  Set its permissions so that only the owner can read and write to it.
3.  Create a script `hello.sh` and give only the owner execute permissions.
4.  Create a shared directory where members of your group can add and modify files, but others can only read.

## 🌐 Networking Mastery

A deep understanding of networking is non-negotiable for any serious Linux user, administrator, or security professional. This section covers the foundational concepts, tools, and protocols.

### Core Concepts: TCP/IP and the OSI Model

Before touching the tools, you must understand the rules of the road.

**The OSI Model (A Quick Look)**

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstract layers.

| Layer | Name | Purpose | Common Protocols |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | Application | Human-computer interaction | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SSH |
| 6 | Presentation | Data formatting, encryption | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG |
| 5 | Session | Manages connections | NetBIOS, SAP |
| 4 | Transport | End-to-end connections, reliability | **TCP**, **UDP** |
| 3 | Network | Path determination, IP addressing | **IP**, ICMP, OSPF |
| 2 | Data Link | Physical addressing (MAC) | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP |
| 1 | Physical | Hardware, electrical signals | Cables, Hubs |

**TCP vs. UDP**

The two most important protocols at the Transport Layer (Layer 4) are TCP and UDP.

| Feature | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) | UDP (User Datagram Protocol) |
|---|---|---|
| **Connection** | Connection-oriented (establishes a session) | Connectionless (fire and forget) |
| **Reliability** | High (guarantees delivery, order, and integrity) | Low (no guarantees) |
| **Header Size** | 20 bytes | 8 bytes |
| **Speed** | Slower (due to overhead) | Faster (less overhead) |
| **Use Cases** | Web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP) | Streaming video/audio, online gaming, DNS |

**Ports, Protocols, and Sockets**

*   **Port:** A numerical identifier (0-65535) on a host that directs traffic to a specific service or application.
*   **Protocol:** A set of rules governing data exchange (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP).
*   **Socket:** The combination of an IP address and a port number (`<IP_Address>:<Port>`), forming a unique endpoint for communication.

### Essential Networking Tools

#### Network Diagnostics and Analysis

These tools are your first line of defense for troubleshooting and exploration.

| Command | Description | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ping` | Test basic connectivity | `ping -c 4 8.8.8.8` | Sends ICMP packets. `-c` specifies the count. |
| `traceroute` | Trace the network path to a host | `traceroute google.com` | Shows every router (hop) your packets travel through. |
| `mtr` | **M**y **Tr**aceroute | `mtr google.com` | Combines `ping` and `traceroute` into a real-time diagnostic tool. |
| `dig` | **D**omain **I**nformation **G**roper | `dig google.com MX` | A powerful tool for DNS queries. Far more detailed than `nslookup`. |
| `nslookup` | **N**ame **S**erver **Lookup** | `nslookup github.com` | A simpler tool for DNS queries. |
| `ss` | **S**ocket **S**tatistics | `ss -tulnpa` | The modern tool to inspect sockets. Replaces `netstat`. |

**Deep Dive: `ss` Command Options**

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-t` | Show **T**CP sockets. |
| `-u` | Show **U**DP sockets. |
| `-l` | Show **l**istening sockets. |
| `-n` | Show **n**umerical addresses (don't resolve hostnames). |
| `-p` | Show the **p**rocess using the socket. |
| `-a` | Show **a**ll sockets (listening and established). |

**Exercises: Diagnostics**

1.  Verify you have a connection to the internet.
2.  Trace the path to `mit.edu`. How many hops does it take?
3.  Find the mail exchange (MX) records for `protonmail.com`.
4.  List all listening TCP sockets on your machine and the processes using them.

#### The Network Swiss Army Knives

These tools are incredibly versatile and are used for everything from simple tests to complex security tasks.

| Tool | Description | Key Use Cases |
|---|---|---|
| `nmap` | **N**etwork **Map**per | Port scanning, service version detection, OS detection, vulnerability scanning. |
| `netcat` (`nc`) | The "TCP/IP Swiss army knife" | Port scanning, banner grabbing, file transfer, creating backdoors. |
| `tcpdump` | Command-line packet analyzer | Capturing and analyzing raw network traffic from the terminal. |
| `Wireshark` | GUI packet analyzer | Deep, graphical inspection of network protocols and packet contents. |

**Deep Dive: `nmap` Scans**

`nmap` is the world's most famous port scanner, essential for reconnaissance.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `nmap <target>` | A basic scan of the top 1000 TCP ports. |
| `nmap -sS <target>` | **S**YN **S**can (Stealth Scan): The default for privileged users. Fast and less likely to be logged. |
| `nmap -sT <target>` | **T**CP **C**onnect Scan: Completes the three-way handshake. Slower and noisier. |
| `nmap -sU <target>` | **U**DP Scan: Scans for open UDP ports. Much slower than TCP scans. |
| `nmap -p- <target>` | Scan all 65,535 ports. |
| `nmap -p 80,443 <target>` | Scan specific ports. |
| `nmap -sV <target>` | **S**ervice **V**ersion detection: Tries to determine the software and version running on open ports. |
| `nmap -O <target>` | **O**S detection: Attempts to identify the operating system of the target. |
| `nmap -A <target>` | **A**ggressive Scan: Enables OS detection (`-O`), version detection (`-sV`), script scanning (`-sC`), and traceroute. |
| `nmap --script vuln <target>` | Runs scripts from the `vuln` category to check for known vulnerabilities. |

**Deep Dive: `netcat` (`nc`)**

`netcat` can create almost any kind of connection you need.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `nc -zv <target> 1-1024` | **Z**ero-I/O **v**erbose scan: A simple way to check for open ports in a range. |
| `nc -l -p <port>` | **L**isten on a specific port, creating a simple server. |
| `echo "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | nc <target> 80` | **Banner Grabbing:** Connect to a web server and grab the HTTP header. |
| `nc -l -p 1234 > received_file` | On the receiving machine, listen and redirect output to a file. |
| `nc <receiver_ip> 1234 < file_to_send` | On the sending machine, connect and send a file. |

**Exercises: Advanced Tools**

1.  **(Use with caution and only on targets you own!)** Scan `scanme.nmap.org` to find its open ports and the services running on them.
2.  Use `netcat` to grab the HTTP banner from `example.com` on port 80.
3.  Set up a `netcat` listener on port 4444 on your machine. In another terminal, connect to it. Type a message and see it appear on the listener.
4.  Use `tcpdump` to capture ICMP traffic while you `ping 8.8.8.8`. (Command: `sudo tcpdump -i <interface> icmp`).

## 🔒 Offensive Security (Ethical Hacking)

**⚠️ ETHICAL DISCLAIMER:** The techniques in this section are for educational purposes and authorized testing only. Always obtain explicit written permission before testing any system you don't own. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.

### The Hacker Methodology

Professional penetration testing follows a structured approach:

1. **Reconnaissance** - Information gathering
2. **Scanning & Enumeration** - Finding vulnerabilities
3. **Exploitation** - Gaining access
4. **Post-Exploitation** - Maintaining access and pivoting
5. **Reporting** - Documenting findings and remediation

### Reconnaissance & Information Gathering

The first phase involves gathering as much information as possible about the target without directly interacting with their systems.

#### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
